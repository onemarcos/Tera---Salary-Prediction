The objective of this project is to help companies and employees to negotiate salaries based on data.

## EDA Ok

## Model OK

## Conclusion

Our calculator did not achieve good enough performance, producing results with an RMSE of 4,000. It was not possible to find a logic to justify salary discrepancies for similar profiles because salary is not directly related to the variables tested.

When applying the Linear Regression model, it was not considered satisfactory for salary prediction as the Adj. R-squared result was 0.324. The Random Forest model was also not considered satisfactory as the metrics results were too low.

Although we tested other models, the gains were marginal, so we will need to find other variables/datasets that demonstrate better explanatory power.
